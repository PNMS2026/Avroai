## Step 7: Deploy!

1. Scroll to the bottom
2. Click the big blue **"Create Web Service"** button
3. **WAIT** - Don't close the tab!

---

## Step 8: Watch the Deployment

You'll see logs appearing in real-time:

**What you should see:**

```
==> Cloning from https://github.com/PNMS2026/Avroai...
==> Running build command 'npm install'
...adding packages...
==> Build successful ðŸŽ‰
==> Starting service with 'npm start'
âœ… Connected to MongoDB
ðŸš€ Server running on http://localhost:3000
Your service is live ðŸŽ‰
```

**This takes 3-5 minutes.**

---

## Step 9: Get Your Backend URL

Once deployment is complete:

1. Look at the top of the page
2. You'll see your URL: **https://avroai.onrender.com** (or similar)
3. **Copy this URL** - you'll need it!

---

## Step 10: Test Your Backend

Open a new tab and visit:
```
https://your-service-name.onrender.com/api/tools
```

**Expected result:** JSON data with your AI tools

**If you see JSON:** âœ… SUCCESS! Backend is working!

**If you see 502:** Continue to next section (MongoDB config)

## Common Issues During Deploy

### Issue: "Repository not found"
**Fix:** 
- Make sure you installed Render on your GitHub account
- Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Applications â†’ Render â†’ Configure
- Grant access to PNMS2026/Avroai repository

### Issue: "Build failed"
**Fix:**
- Check the logs for the exact error
- Usually it's missing package.json or syntax error
- Your code is fine, so this shouldn't happen

### Issue: "Service keeps restarting"
**Fix:**
- Go to "Logs" tab
- Look for error messages
- Usually MongoDB connection issue (fix in next step)

---

## âœ… You're Done with This Step!

Once you see "Your service is live ðŸŽ‰" in the logs, move to the next step.

**Your backend URL:** https://avroai.onrender.com (or your custom name)

---

**Next:** Configure MongoDB Atlas to allow connections
