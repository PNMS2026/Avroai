🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

**Key indicators of success:**
- ✅ No errors during `npm install`
- ✅ "Connected to MongoDB" message
- ✅ "Server running" message
- ✅ No crash or restart loops

---

## ❌ Common Errors and Fixes

### Error 1: Module Not Found

**Log Output:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'express'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename
```

**Cause:** Missing dependencies in package.json or build failed

**Fix:**
1. Check `package.json` has all dependencies
2. In Render, go to "Settings" → "Build Command"
3. Verify it's: `npm install`
4. Trigger manual redeploy

---

### Error 2: MongoDB Connection Failed

**Log Output:**
```
❌ MongoDB connection error: MongooseServerSelectionError: 
Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster.
```

**Cause:** MongoDB Atlas not allowing connections

**Fix:**
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas
2. Network Access → Add 0.0.0.0/0
3. Wait 1-2 minutes
4. Restart Render service

**Alternative causes:**
- Wrong MONGODB_URI in environment variables
- MongoDB cluster is paused/deleted
- Network issues (temporary)

---

### Error 3: Port Binding Error

**Log Output:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

**Cause:** Port already in use (rare on Render)

**Fix:**
1. Check environment variable PORT is set to `3000`
2. Restart service
3. If persists, contact Render support

---

### Error 4: Application Crash / Exit

**Log Output:**
```
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 1
npm ERR! avroai-directory@1.0.0 start: `node server.js`
npm ERR! Exit status 1
```

**Cause:** Application crashed during startup

**Fix:**
1. Look at logs ABOVE this error for the actual cause
2. Common causes:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Syntax error in code
   - Database connection failure
3. Fix the root cause and redeploy

---

### Error 5: Build Failed

**Log Output:**
```
==> Build failed 😞
==> Check logs above for details
```

**Cause:** Build process failed (npm install error)

**Fix:**
1. Scroll up in logs to find the actual error
2. Common causes:
   - package.json syntax error
   - Incompatible Node version
   - Missing package-lock.json
3. Fix and push to GitHub (auto-redeploys)

---

### Error 6: 502 Bad Gateway (Service Down)

**Log Output:**
```
Service is not responding to health checks
```

**OR no logs at all / service not starting**

**Cause:** Service failed to start or crashed immediately

**Fix:**
1. Check "Events" tab to see if deployment succeeded
2. Check environment variables are set
3. Check MongoDB Atlas network access
4. Review build logs for errors
5. Make sure Start Command is: `npm start`

---

## 🔍 Log Filters and Search

### Filter by Log Level
Render shows different types of logs:
- **Build logs** (during deployment)
- **Application logs** (from your code)
- **System logs** (from Render)

### Search Logs
1. Use Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac) to search
2. Search for:
   - `error` → Find errors
   - `MongoDB` → Check database connection
   - `Server running` → Confirm startup
   - `✅` or `❌` → Find success/failure

### Time Range
- Logs show recent activity (last few hours)
- For older logs, check "Events" tab for deployment history

---

## 📊 Interpreting Build Logs

### Stage 1: Pulling Code
```
==> Cloning from https://github.com/PNMS2026/Avroai...
==> Checking out commit 55c8e29
```
✅ **Good:** Code pulled from GitHub successfully

### Stage 2: Installing Dependencies
```
==> Running build command 'npm install'
added 249 packages in 15s
```
✅ **Good:** All packages installed

❌ **Bad:** 
```
npm ERR! code ENOTFOUND
npm ERR! Cannot resolve package
```
**Fix:** Check package.json for typos

### Stage 3: Starting Service
```
==> Starting service with 'npm start'
```
✅ **Good:** Service is starting

❌ **Bad:**
```
Error: Cannot find start script
```
**Fix:** Add to package.json:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js"
}
```

## 🔄 Monitoring Active Service

### What to Look For

**Healthy Service:**
- No constant errors in logs
- No restart loops
- Response to health checks
- Status shows: ● Live

**Unhealthy Service:**
- Continuous error messages
- Service restarts every few seconds
- Status shows: ○ Down
- 502 errors when accessing URL

### Real-Time Monitoring
1. Keep Logs tab open
2. Watch for incoming requests:
   ```
   GET /api/tools 200 45ms
   GET /api/categories 200 23ms
   ```
3. These are good signs - API is responding
